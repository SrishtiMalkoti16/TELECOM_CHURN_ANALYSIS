**Problem Statement**
The problem addressed in this project is the customer churn rate in Orange Telecom. Customer churn refers to the number of customers who discontinue their subscription within a specific period. The objective is to explore and analyze the data to uncover the key factors responsible for customer churn. Based on the findings, recommendations will be provided to enhance customer retention. 

**Business Objective**
The primary business objective of this project is twofold:

* Uncover the primary elements influencing customer attrition: Through a thorough examination of customer activity data, our goal is to discern patterns and correlations that provide insights into the reasons behind subscription cancellations.

* Offer strategies for customer retention: In light of the analysis findings, we will suggest practical recommendations to Orange Telecom for preserving valuable customer relationships. These proposals may encompass targeted marketing initiatives, enhanced customer service, or service improvements tailored to address identified pain points.
